      Now that we’ve covered the basics in regards to RSU’s we can dive into the planning opportunities around them. The most common question RSU recipients have is, should I hold, sell, or diversify my stock? In an attempt to answer this question, please keep in mind every person’s situation is different and several factors must be considered. <br><br>

      You may consider holding your vested shares of company stock if you believe the company is on a growth trajectory. The first company that comes to mind is Amazon, and it’s massive growth over the past 20 years. Employees who decided to sit on their stock in the early years have more than likely become very wealthy. However, with any concentrated position, there comes risk. Having “all your egg’s in one basket” inherently increases the risk your taking with your investments. While it may seem an investment is less risky because you know the company and you work there, it doesn’t change the simple fact that concentrated positions involve more risk than a diversified portfolio. If RSU’s are continually being granted, you may consider selling a portion of the stock and diversifying elsewhere, knowing that you’ll be receiving more company stock in the future. <br><br>

      Recapping on the tax implications, if you decide to hold company stock, remember GAINS are taxed at better rates if the stock is held for longer than a year. For example, if you have stock you’ve held for 9 months that’s appreciated in value by 15%, that 15% gain will be taxed at your ordinary income bracket if sold. Whereas if you waited an additional 3 months to sell the stock, the 15% gain would be taxed at the lower long-term capital gains bracket, potentially saving a lot of money in taxes. <br><br>

      Secondly, you may decide to sell the vested company stock immediately, or shortly thereafter. This could be a consideration for the mere fact of diversifying or potentially use the proceeds towards other financial goals such as a home downpayment, paying off high interest debt, building an emergency fund, or saving for kids college expenses. <br><br>

      <b>Key Takeaway</b><br>
      RSU’s are a great benefit to have and understanding how they fit into your holistic financial situation is key to maximizing them. The key things to remember are the income tax consequences, and the potential to build up a fairly risky portfolio if the stock makes up the majority of your portfolio or net worth. While there’s nothing wrong with concentrated positions in company stock, it’s important to be aware of the risk and the potential pitfalls it could pose to your overall financial situation should the stock experience a dramatic downturn.
